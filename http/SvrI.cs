	 In its idling state, an HTTP server does nothing but listening to the IP address(es) and port(s) specified in the configuration for incoming request. When a request arrives, the server analyzes the message header, applies rules specified in the configuration, and takes the appropriate action. The webmaster's main control over the action of web server is via the configuration, which will be dealt with in greater details in the later sections.
